Bonus Request Document:
//TODO: continue it 
We would like to request a bonus for the following contributions we made to the project:

Command Line Enhancements
We improved the command line functionality by adding support for handling spaces in the arguments. 
This required careful validation and testing to ensure a smooth and reliable user experience.

Game Visualization
We extended the project by adding a visualization feature for the game. 
This provided a more engaging and intuitive way to observe the gameplay and significantly enhanced the usability and presentation of the project.

Detailed Logging System
We implemented a comprehensive logging mechanism that writes detailed information to a file named detailed. 
This feature makes it easier to debug, analyze, and track the gameâ€™s execution flow, providing greater transparency and control.
